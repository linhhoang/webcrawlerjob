       <div class="clearfix">  Born October 21, 1891, in St. Johns, Michigan, Leo Burnett gained his first exposure to advertising layout and copy at his father’s dry goods store. In 1914, he graduated from the University of Michigan with a degree in journalism and landed a job earning $18 a week as a reporter at the Peoria (Ill.) Journal.  Burnett went on to become advertising manager for the Detroit-based Cadillac Motor Company and creative head at the Homer McKee Company, Indianapolis’ leading ad agency, before moving to Chicago and assuming the position of create vice president for Erwin Wasey advertising agency.  Borrowing against his life insurance policy, mortgaging his home, and scraping together “every cent and pants button” he could find, on August 5, 1935, the 44-year-old entrepreneur founded Leo Burnett Company, Inc., the first office being a suite in Chicago’s Palmer House hotel.  With the firm belief that “the work of an advertising agency is warmly and immediately human and deals with human needs, wants, dreams and hopes,” Burnett set out to create that kind of advertising. And did. Working hard and long hours – often beginning his days at 5 a.m. – his capacity for endless labor inspired those whom he employed.  “Leo had that ability, like a good athletic coach has, of making you do better than you thought you could,” recalled his wife, Naomi. “In pleasing him, you were pleased with yourself. He somehow improved everything he touched, with either his black pencil or by his example. He had infinite patience.”  Through 36 years under its spirited founder – the last four of which he assumed the title of founder chairman – the Leo Burnett Company created some of history’s most enduring advertising campaigns, ranging from the Marlboro Cowboy to Kellogg’s Tony the Tiger to the “Friendly Skies” of United Airlines to the Jolly Green Giant, among others. Although Burnett died in 1971, his original corporate mission to “Create the best advertising in the world – bar none” today continues to motivate more than 8,000 intensely loyal Burnetters in more than 80 offices worldwide.
